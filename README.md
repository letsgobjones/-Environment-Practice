# EnvironmentPractice: SwiftUI State Management with Environment and Observation

This project demonstrates a combined approach to global state management in SwiftUI, using the `Environment` for injection and `Observation` for reactive updates.

## Key Features

* **Environment Injection (@Environment):** Injects a shared instance of the `AppState` class into the environment, making it globally accessible to all views.
* **Observation (@Observable, @Bindable):**
    * Marks the `AppState` class as observable (`@Observable`).
    * Uses the `@Bindable` property wrapper to create a binding to the `appState` instance within views, enabling direct modification and automatic UI updates.
* **Combined Approach:**  Leverages the strengths of both `Environment` (global access) and `Observation` (reactive updates) for efficient and flexible state management.

## Techniques Used

* **Environment**:  Provides a mechanism to inject an object into the environment for global access.
* **Observable:** Marks a class as observable, allowing its properties to be observed for changes.
* **Bindable:** Creates a binding to an observable object's property, enabling two-way data flow.
* **View Composition**:  Organizes the UI into modular components (`LightBulbView`, `LightRoomView`, `ContentView`).
* **Conditional Rendering**:  Dynamically adjusts the UI based on the state of the `AppState` object.

## Code Structure

* `AppState.swift`: Contains the `AppState` class, marked with `@Observable`, holding the shared `isOn` state.
* `LightBulbView.swift`: A reusable view for a light bulb that can be toggled on and off. Uses `@Environment` to access the `AppState` and `@Bindable` to modify its `isOn` property.
* `LightRoomView.swift`: A container view for the `LightBulbView`.
* `ContentView.swift`: The main view that sets up the environment by injecting the `AppState` instance. It also displays the light room and adjusts its background color based on the `isOn` state.

## How It Works

1. An instance of `AppState` is created and injected into the environment at the root of the app.
2. Views access the shared `AppState` instance using `@Environment(AppState.self)`.
3. The `LightBulbView` uses `@Bindable` to create a binding to the `appState` instance.
4. Modifying the `isOn` property within `LightBulbView` (e.g., through the toggle) triggers updates in all views that have injected `AppState` into their environment.

## Benefits

* **Global State Accessibility:**  Easily access and modify shared state from any view in the hierarchy.
* **Reactivity:** Changes to the shared state automatically propagate and trigger UI updates in relevant views.
* **Reduced Prop Drilling:** Avoids the need to pass state manually through multiple layers of views.
* **Separation of Concerns:**  Maintains a clear separation between the state (`AppState`) and the views that use it.
